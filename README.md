# 💫 About Me:
I earned a Master’s degree in Artificial Intelligence from the University of Bologna and completed an internship at PwC Italy. I currently work as an AI Engineer and Team Lead at CMCC (Euro-Mediterranean Center on Climate Change), where I lead and contribute to applied AI research projects at the intersection of climate science and machine learning. With over 11 years of experience in software engineering and AI development, I have developed strong expertise in machine learning, deep learning, natural language processing (NLP), computer vision, and software development, with a particular focus on Python and Java.

At CMCC, I have led multiple AI-driven research projects. One project focused on image compression pipelines for large-scale model training, where I evaluated lossy compression techniques to reduce storage and I/O costs while preserving model performance. In another project, I worked on wildfire prediction using deep learning, developing spatio-temporal models to forecast fire risk from climate and environmental data, supporting early warning and decision-making systems.

For my Master’s thesis, I worked on readability assessment for text simplification, strengthening my understanding of NLP methods and their real-world applications. Throughout my career, I have contributed to a wide range of AI projects, sharpening my skills in data analysis, machine learning, deep learning, and statistical modeling. I have designed and implemented AI-based solutions across domains such as predictive analytics, computer vision, and data visualization, demonstrating my ability to tackle complex, real-world challenges.

I am highly motivated, adaptable, and passionate about continuous learning. I enjoy working in collaborative, high-performing teams and staying at the forefront of AI innovation, with a strong commitment to delivering robust, high-impact solutions.
